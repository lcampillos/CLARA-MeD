### Compute Inflesz value of a list of sentences

This code leverages the code prepared by [Alejandro Muñoz](https://github.com/alejandromunozes/legibilidad/).

The input is a file with sentences; the Inflesz value is computed for each sentence.
The average and standard deviation of all Inflesz values are returned.

To use the script:
- Clone the github repository by Alejandro Muñoz: ```git clone https://github.com/alejandromunozes/legibilidad/```
- Download the scripts there described and place them in the cloned repository: 
  -  ```legibilidad.py```
  -  ```nal.py```
  -  ```separasilabas.py```
- Run the script in the repository: ```python compute_inflesz.py <FILE>```
